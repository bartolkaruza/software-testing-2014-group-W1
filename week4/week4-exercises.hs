---- BONUS
{- if we define the value that we put in as v then we can see that the formula is (x+v/x)/2. When x=sqrt(v) then v/x=x, so in that case 
   the output is (x+x)/2=x, which makes the if statement get into the if clause instead of the else clause and the program terminates. 
   As written earlier, in this case x=sqrt(v).
